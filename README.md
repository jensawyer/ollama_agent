A simple agent where the LLM is running within Ollama.

All other agent code is regular Python without the use of any abstracting libraries. This is to show what is really 
going on in a clear, un-opinionated way. I believe is the best way to learn or teach others as you should understand
what the library is "helping" you with to understand whether it's really truly helping at all.
